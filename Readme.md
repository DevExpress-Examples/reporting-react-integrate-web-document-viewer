# Reporting for React -  Add a Web Document Viewer to a React App

This example incorporates the Web Document Viewer into a client-side app built with React. The example consists of two parts:

- The [ServerSideApp](ServerSideApp) folder contains the backend project. The project is anÂ ASP.NET Core application that enables [cross-domain requests (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) (Access-Control-Allow-Origin) and implements custom web report storage.


- The [react-document-viewer](react-document-viewer) folder contains the client application built with React.

## Quick Start

### Server

In the *ServerSideApp/ServerSideApp* folder, run the following command:


```
dotnet run
```

The server starts at http://localhost:5000. To debug the server, run the application in Visual Studio.

### Client

In the *react-document-viewer* folder, run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser to view the result. The application displays the Web Document Viewer with the *TestReport* report.

## Customization Examples

This project contains code snippets used for client-side customization and reflected in our online help topics. Each code snippet is enclosed in a `page.tsx` file in a separate folder. After running the project, open the following folders to see the result:

| Location | Description |
| --- | --- |
| /custom-export-to-button | Hides the [Export Options panel](https://devexpress.github.io/dotnet-eud/reporting-for-web/articles/document-viewer/exporting/export-a-document.html), adds a button to export the report to a file in XLSX format, and specifies the `Author` export option. |
| /custom-parameter-lookup-source | Populates parameter editors with values obtained on the client. |
| /customize-export-options | Specifies the "&#124;"" symbol as a separator for CSV data export. |
| /customize-export-toolbar-item | Adds a new `Image: JPEG` item in the Export drop-down menu and binds it to the `ExportTo` action.
| /customize-parameter-editor-options | Removes time part from a calendar editor in the Parameters panel. | 
| /export-options-hide-format | Removes the `XLS` format from the **Export To** drop-down list and from the **Export Options** panel.
| /get-parameters-model | Obtains values that the user selects in the multi-value parameter editor. | 
| /get-preview-model | Collapses the tab panel when the user clicks **Reset** in the **Parameters** tab. |
| /goto-next-page | Automatically navigates through the document pages. |
| /open-report | Loads the specified report. |
| /parameters-events | Handles report parameter events. |
| /property-changes-processing | Sets the zoom level to 25%, enables multi-page mode, and indicates the moment when the first page is loaded. |
| /submit-parameters | Passes a parameter to the report and rebuilds the document. |
