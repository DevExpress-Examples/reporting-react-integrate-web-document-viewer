# Reporting for React -  How to Integrate the Web Document Viewer in React App

This example shows how to incorporate the Web Document Viewer into a client-side app built with React. The example consists of two parts:

- A server (back-end)Â ASP.NET Core application that enables [cross-domain requests (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) (Access-Control-Allow-Origin) and implements a custom web report storage.

- A React front-end client application.

## Run the Example

Perform the following steps to run this example:

1. Open the back-end project solution (*ServerSideApp/ServerSideApp.sln*) in Visual Studio and run the project.
2. Navigate to the *react-document-viewer* folder that is the client part's root folder.
3. Open the console and run the following command:

    ```npm install```

4. Run the command to compile and start the client part:

    ```npm start```

5. The client application opens the browser at http://localhost:3000/. It displays the **Document Viewer** with the **TestReport** report.

> [!TIP]
> Make sure that the backend application runs on the port specified in the host setting of the Document Viewer component.
